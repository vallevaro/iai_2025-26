    "## üìñ **Introduction**\n",
    "A **Genetic Algorithm (GA)** is an optimization technique inspired by the process of natural selection üå±. It mimics biological evolution to find solutions to optimization and search problems. By evolving a population of solutions through selection, crossover, and mutation, GAs are particularly effective in complex problem spaces where traditional methods might struggle.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üß† **Key Concepts**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Population** üë•: A collection of potential solutions to the problem, each called a \"chromosome\" or \"individual.\"\n",
    "2. **Chromosome** üß¨: Represents a possible solution. It's usually encoded as a string (often binary) that defines the characteristics of the solution.\n",
    "3. **Fitness Function** üí™: A function that evaluates and scores each chromosome based on how well it solves the problem.\n",
    "4. **Selection** üéØ: The process of choosing the fittest individuals to pass their genes to the next generation.\n",
    "5. **Crossover** üîó: A genetic operator that combines two parent chromosomes to produce offspring. It mimics reproduction and the inheritance of traits.\n",
    "6. **Mutation** ‚ö°: A genetic operator that introduces small random changes to individual chromosomes to maintain diversity and prevent premature convergence.\n",
    "7. **Evolution** üîÑ: The iterative process where the population is evolved over multiple generations to improve the overall fitness.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üß¨ **Steps in a Genetic Algorithm**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization** üå±:\n",
    "   - Begin with a randomly generated population of individuals (chromosomes).\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Fitness Evaluation** üìä:\n",
    "   - Evaluate each individual in the population using the **fitness function** to measure how good it is at solving the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Selection** üéØ:\n",
    "   - Select individuals based on their fitness scores. Fitter individuals have a higher chance of being chosen for reproduction, mimicking the concept of \"survival of the fittest.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Crossover (Recombination)** üîó:\n",
    "   - For each pair of selected parents, combine their genetic material to create new offspring. This is often done by swapping portions of their chromosome strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Mutation** ‚ö°:\n",
    "   - Apply small random changes to some offspring to maintain diversity in the population and avoid getting stuck in local optima.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Replacement** üîÑ:\n",
    "   - Replace some or all of the old population with the new offspring, creating the next generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Termination** üèÅ:\n",
    "   - Repeat the process of evaluation, selection, crossover, and mutation until a termination condition is met, such as a maximum number of generations or convergence to a solution.\n",
